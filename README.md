openstack-tools
===============
This project contains some custom tools/scripts that I use while doing openstack development. Most of this is quick and dirty scripting.
Some of these are more for learning than real development.

- os-ns-visualizer: visualizes namespaces created by openstack on a system
- cleanup: scripts to quickly cleanup openstack resources
- mynose: wrapper script for nosetests that cleans output
